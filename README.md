# SmartBox Control System
Welcome to MakeGreatBox, a solution developed during LauzHack to tackle the challenge of controlling a production machine in a cardboard box factory. This system streamlines the process of managing box production by introducing a centralized, user-friendly interface for monitoring, configuring, and controlling the production line in real time.

# Features
Real-time Machine Monitoring: Track the current status of the production machine (e.g., speed, temperature, and errors).

Production Configuration: Customize parameters such as box dimensions, material thickness, and batch size.

Error Management: Receive alerts and troubleshoot machine errors efficiently.

Performance Analytics: View production metrics such as throughput and machine utilization.

Historical Data: View what happened on specific dates to better understand how it's going.
